                <h1 style="font-size: 35px;">Introduction:</h1>
                <p>
                    In our <span style="font-weight: bold;">previous</span> article, we talked about how much Google will suffer <br>
                    if their deal with Apple breaks up due to the lawsuit. However, <br>
                    recent analysis and statements released by officials have told us that<br>
                    Apple will also suffer a great loss if this Billion dollar deal with <br>
                    Google breaks up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst for Bernstein said that “there is a risk if <br>
                    you play it out, that there actually could be a greater financial loss to<br>
                    Apple than there is for Google”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Analsyts have predicted that Apple’s revenue could decrease more <br>
                    20% if the lawsuit against Google manages to break its important <br>
                    deal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lawsuits describe this deal as code red in terms of laws. They <br>
                    also said that Google has used illegal ways of boosting its traffic <br>
                    from Apple products that lead to enormous profit.
                </p>
                <h1 style="font-size: 35px;">What will Apple lose?</h1>
                <p>
                    It is quite clear that not only Google but Apple will also suffer an <br>
                    economic loss from this lawsuit. It is estimated that Google’s<br>
                    payment to Apple is nearly $8 billion to $12 billion per year. If this<br>
                    deal breaks up, this money won’t be paid to Apple. These earnings <br>
                    make up 20% of Apple’s net income. It’s quite a havoc in between <br>
                    both of these companies.
                </p>
               
                <h1 style="font-size: 35px;">What is Google saying in its  defense?</h1>
                <p>
                    Google didn’t provide a logical argument in its defense. Google’s<br>
                    senior VP, Kent Walker said that it is easy to change the browser<br>
                    settings in Apple’s devices if the user wants to and all of these <br>
                    agreements are no different than the agreements which previous <br>
                    company used when distributing their software”. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apple investors have also been asked questions regarding their<br>
                    iPhone 12’s sales all over the world due to pandemic situations. If <br>
                    something happens to this deal, both company’s economy will be at <br>
                    risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No one can say how this lawsuit will proceed. We can’t also say, how <br>
                    much danger Google and Apple are in right now. But it is safe to say <br>
                    that the Department of Justice is taking action against all the illegal <br>
                    things and agreements done by big tech companies. We have to <br>
                    wait for a long 16 month time period for the final verdict.
                </p>
                <h1 style="font-size: 35px;">Conclusion:</h1>
                <p>
                    All these big firms are playing with their customers for their own <br>
                    benefits and earnings. They have gradually locked us into an<br>
                    ecosphere of business from, which we can’t come out that easily.
